# ⚔️ Rogue Gauntlet

Rogue Gauntlet is a roguelike game built with C# in the Godot game engine. The game is inspired by classic roguelikes such as NetHack as well as Gauntlet, a classic arcade game.

Currently, this project is in the early stages of development. The game is not yet playable, but the basic mechanics are in place. The game is being developed as a learning project to improve my skills with C# and the Godot game engine. It is also a fun way to explore game development and design.
